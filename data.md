<h2 id="publs">Data</h2>
I lead and collaborate on different data projects. I have collected and analyzed observational data, nationally representative surveys, and survey experiments. I also analyze geospatial and digital behavior data in my current research projects. Below is a list of larger projects I have been involved in.<br>

<p style="margin-bottom:.5cm;">The Manifesto Project provides information on parties' policy positions derived from a content analysis of parties' electoral manifestos. It covers over 1000 parties since 1945 in over 50 countries on five continents. The project also provides access to manifesto texts and content-analytical data and gives accessible ways to easily explore and visualise the data and text corpus. </p>
