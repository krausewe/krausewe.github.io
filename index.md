  Welcome to my webpage! <br> 

  I am a political scientist at the Chair of Comparative Politics of the University of Potsdam, where I teach classes on comparative politics, political behavior, and research methods. Previously, I worked as a research fellow at the University of Vienna, the Humboldt University of Berlin and the WZB Berlin Social Science Center. I was also a visiting scholar at the University of Essex.<br>
  
  My research areas include political representation, party competition, political radicalism/extremism, and quantitative methods with a focus on causal inference. In my current research projects, I study political phenomena such as democratic responsiveness, political violence, and citizens' voting behavior. My work has been published in different academic journals, like <i>Comparative Political Studies</i>, the <i>British Journal of Political Science</i>, <i>Political Science Research and Methods</i>, <i>West European Politics</i>, or <i>Party Politics</i>. I contributed chapters to books published by <i>Cambridge University Press</i> and <i>Springer VS</i>. <br>  
        
  My work and the projects I contributed to have been covered in various national and international media outlets, such as The Guardian, the New York Times, and The Washington Post. Click <a href="./outreach.html">here</a> for a comprehensive list of my media appearances.
 <br>

  Currently, I am a principal investigator in the DFG funded project <i>Powerful Polls? The Influence of Public Opinion Polls on Elections in Representative Democracies</i> and the data project <i>Political Parties, Presidents, Elections, and Governments</i> (<a href="https://ppeg.wzb.eu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PPEG</a>). In the past, I was part of the project <i>Manifesto Research on Political Representation</i> (<a href="https://manifesto-project.wzb.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MARPOR</a>) and contributed to the <i>Issue Competition Comparative Project</i> (<a href="https://cise.luiss.it/iccp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ICCP</a>). <br>

Together with Tarik Abou-Chadi (University of Oxford) and Denis Cohen (University of Mannheim), I discuss the current interaction between Germany's center-right and radical right parties. Based on our research, we argue that the increasing rhetorical and positional convergence between both parties will strengthen the radical right.

Lawrence Ezrow and I analyze whether political parties become more responsive to public opinion after decreases in turnout. We investigate this question based on data from thirteen democracies from 1977 to 2018. The article presents evidence that declining voter turnout in one inter-election period is associated with increasing party responsiveness to public opinion in the following election.</td>
