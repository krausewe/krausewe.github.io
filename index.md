  Welcome to my webpage! <br> 

  I am a political scientist at the <a href="https://staatswissenschaft.univie.ac.at/en/about-us/scientific-staff/werner-krause/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Department of Government</a> of the University of Vienna, where I teach classes on comparative politics, political behavior, and research methods. Previously, I worked as a research fellow at the Humboldt University of Berlin and at the WZB Berlin Social Science Center. I was also a visiting scholar at the University of Essex.<br>
  
  My research areas include political representation, party competition, political radicalism/extremism, and quantitative methods with a focus on causal inference. In my current research projects, I study political phenomena such as democratic responsiveness, political violence, and citizens' voting behavior. My work has been published in different academic journals, like the <i>British Journal of Political Science</i>, <i>Political Science Research and Methods</i>, <i>West European Politics</i>, or <i>Party Politics</i>. I contributed chapters to books published by <i>Cambridge University Press</i> and <i>Springer VS</i>. <br>  
        
  My work and the projects I contributed to have been covered in various national and international media outlets, such as The Guardian, the New York Times, and The Washington Post. Click <a href="./outreach.html">here</a> for a comprehensive list of my media appearances.
 <br>

  Currently, I am a lead investigator in the data project <i>Political Parties, Presidents, Elections, and Governments</i> (<a href="https://ppeg.wzb.eu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PPEG</a>). In the past, I was part of the project <i>Manifesto Research on Political Representation</i> (<a href="https://manifesto-project.wzb.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MARPOR</a>) and contributed to the <i>Issue Competition Comparative Project</i> (<a href="https://cise.luiss.it/iccp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ICCP</a>). <br>

I presented results of a survey experiment conducted with Christina Gahn. In our research, we ask whether and how public opinion polls can be best communicated to voters and how the different graphical displays of polls affects citizens' vote decisions.</td>

    <td> <i>New publication</i> in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/psrm.2022.8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Political Science Research and Methods</a>. Together with Denis Cohen and Tarik Abou-Chadi, I investigate whether more anti-immigrant positions of mainstream parties help diminish the public support for radical right parties.
<br>We have also summarized the results of our research in a recent article published by <a href= "https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2022/apr/13/copying-far-right-doesnt-help-mainstream-parties">The Guardian</a>. Our research findings were picked up by different German media outlets, such as the <a href= "https://www.swr.de/swraktuell/baden-wuerttemberg/mannheimer-studie-uebernahme-rechter-themen-staerkt-radikale-parteien-100.html">SWR</a>, <a href= "https://www.deutschlandfunkkultur.de/stimmenfang-am-rechten-rand-lohnt-sich-nicht-dlf-kultur-b8cde89c-100.html">Deutschlandfunk Kultur</a>, <a href= "https://ondemand-mp3.dradio.de/file/dradio/2022/04/21/deutschlandfunknova_mariupol_20220421_6d0efc11.mp3">Deutschlandfunk Nova</a>, or <a href= "https://taz.de/Studie-zu-Wahlerfolgen-rechter-Parteien/!5849870/">TAZ - Die Tageszeitung</a>.</td>

Lawrence Ezrow and I analyze whether political parties become more responsive to public opinion after decreases in turnout. We investigate this question based on data from thirteen democracies from 1977 to 2018. The article presents evidence that declining voter turnout in one inter-election period is associated with increasing party responsiveness to public opinion in the following election.</td>
